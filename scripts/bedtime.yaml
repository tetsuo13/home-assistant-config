icon: mdi:bed-clock

description: >-
  Various sequences to run after everyone's gone to bed. Intended to turn off
  devices that may have been forgotten on and enable services that were
  unintentionally left disabled.

sequence:
  #- alias: Enable camera notifications
  #  action: automation.turn_on
  #  entity_id: automation.motion_send_camera_snapshot_notification_on_motion

  #- alias: Enable front door camera notifications
  #  action: switch.turn_on
  #  entity_id: switch.front_door_smart_motion_detection

  # Don't call the "turn on both living room bookshelf lamps" automation for
  # this as it toggles the lights: if they're already off we don't want to
  # toggle them on. Instead, turn off the "main" switch, the same one that's
  # used for the trigger in the automation and the automation will take care
  # of turning off the other lamp.
